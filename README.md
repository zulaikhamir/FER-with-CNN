# FER-with-CNN
This Python script implements a real-time facial emotion detection system using a pre-trained deep learning model. It captures video from the computer's camera, detects faces in each frame using Haar cascades, extracts the facial region, and classifies the detected emotion using a pre-trained neural network model loaded from 'model.h5'. The recognized emotion is then displayed in real-time on the video feed, with bounding boxes around detected faces. The supported emotions include Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. The program exits when the user presses 'q'.
